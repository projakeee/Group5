Xiaomi, also known as Apple of China. It is a Chinese technology company known for providing flagship-grade<br> 
specifications at affordable prices in their smartphones. In 2019, Xiaomi sold more than 120 million smartphone units. They also<br> have a presence in other product categories. I have been usimg<br> Xiaomi products from last three years. Here is my experience of<br> using their products and the reason I think it is one of the best <br> Technology company in the world .
<h2><font face="arial">Smartphones</h2>
Xiaomi is the 4th largest smartphone maker in the world and<br> number one in India. India is a price-conscious economy, and<br> people can’t afford to buy a thousand-dollar smartphone. xiaomi's<br> sub-brand Redmi has solved this issue by offering great specs at $100-$250 price segment; as a result, many other<br> smartphone makers started focusing on this price segment. these<br> phones come with good functional design, mid-range specs, average camera performance and all other basic features required in any smartphone.<br>
<h2></h2>

Other than specs, Xiaomi smartphones have good software<br> experience with their MIUI skin on top of stock Android. Yeah, I<br> know they tend to copy Apple a lot, but I believe it’s fine until what<br> they are doing is satisfying their customers. MIUI comes with a good basic UI which is easy to use and have some unique<br>features like dual apps, private space, app lock and theme store alongside all the industry-standard features.<br> But, the most significant advantage of using an MIUI phone is its regular <br>software update. Xiaomi releases a new version of its software every year and updates almost all smartphones<br> released in last 3–4 years with it. MIUI isn’t without any flaws, one of the most<br> prominent being advertisements in various UI elements. People<br> have been complaining about it for a long time, and finally, Xiaomi<br> decided to ditch the ads in favour of more seamless user-experience.

Xiaomi is also known for making headlines with its smartphone<br> launches. Their MI Mix lineup of phones are known for their<br> unique designs. With the MI Mix 1, Xiaomi was first to start the<br> bezel-less trend. Recently, they showed a video of their upcoming<br> foldable smartphone with first double hinge design. They are also<br> known for their unique marketing stunts. When they first<br> launched in India in 2014 with their Mi 3 smartphone, they started<br> the new trend of online-only products. Also, the phone was available only through flash sales.
